It is one of the simplest data structures where each data element can be randomly accessed by using its index number.",

      "Each element in an array is of the same data type and carries the same size that is 4 bytes.",
      "Elements in the array are stored at contiguous memory locations from which the first element is stored at the smallest memory location.",
      "Elements of the array can be randomly accessed since we can calculate the address of each element of the array with the given base address and the size of the data element.",
      "Index starts with 0.",
      "The array's length is 10, which means we can store 10 elements."

They exist in both single dimension and multiple dimensions. These data structures come into picture when there is a necessity to store multiple elements of similar nature together at one place.",
